## 🎓 How It Works

### Physical Rehabilitation Flow

1. **User Starts Session** — Selects exercise and sets up camera
2. **Real-time Pose Detection** — Backend analyzes each frame via `/api/pose`
3. **Form Validation** — App calculates joint angles and compares to expected ranges
4. **Live Feedback** — User receives instant corrections ("Keep chest up", "Go deeper")
5. **Rep Tracking** — System counts successful reps and records metrics
6. **Session Analysis** — After session, comprehensive scoring via `/api/score`
7. **Progress Tracking** — Results stored in Firestore for long-term analysis

### Pose Detection Pipeline

```
Camera Frame → Base64 Encoding → Flask Backend
    ↓
cv2.imread() → RGB Conversion
    ↓
MediaPipe PoseLandmarker.detect()
    ↓
Extract 33 Joint Landmarks (normalized 0-1 coordinates)
    ↓
Calculate Angles Between Joint Triplets
    ↓
Generate Feedback Based on Exercise Type
    ↓
Return JSON with angles, landmarks, and guidance
```

---

## 🔧 Scoring Algorithm

The final performance score is calculated as:

```
Final Score = (Accuracy × 0.5) + (ROM Score × 0.3) + (Consistency × 0.2)

Where:
- Accuracy = (Correct Reps / Total Reps) × 100
- ROM Score = Based on distance from ideal angle (adjusted for age/BMI)
- Consistency = How uniform reps are (reduced by angle variation)
```

**Grade Mapping:**
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: <60

```
Landing Page → Login/Signup → Role Selection → Onboarding
```

### Patient Flow (Physical Therapy)
```
Dashboard → Select Exercise → Camera Setup → Live Session → Results
```

### Doctor Flow
```
Dashboard → Patient List → Select Patient → View Progress → Adjust Plan
```
